  specific_educational_objectives: The aim of this course is to introduce students to basic topics in discrete mathematics. An overview of proof methods and their relation to logic will be given. The induction principle is introduced in a number of variants, and methods to analyse and describe the main properties of relations, functions, graphs and trees will be studied. We will also introduce the basic principles governing the mathematical definitions of infinite sets and of countability.
