  attendance: "Attendance is not compulsory but recommended. Non-attending students have to contact the lecturer at the start of the course to agree on the modalities of the independent study."
  prerequisites: "The necessary prerequisite for this course is Web and Internet Engineering, as it provides the essential knowledge of HTML and CSS required to follow the course. It is also recommended that students have attended the HCI for Business course from the Business Informatics program, as it covers context-of-use analysis, conceptual modeling, and low to middle fidelity prototyping, which are relevant for this course."

    This course teaches students how to design and develop the interaction of a web application by placing users and their requirements at the center of the design and development process. It begins with a brief overview of user requirements and how to specify them, for example through the use of scenarios. The course then introduces fundamental web design principles and patterns, including aspects such as navigation, color, and visual hierarchy. Students learn how to prototype a web application interface by taking into account user requirements, design principles, and established patterns. Design techniques covered include wireframing and the creation of sitemaps. Finally, the course guides students in developing the interface of a web application using web programming languages.
