  specific_educational_objectives: "Computer scientists learn to master a unique language that allow them to program machines. Such effective communication is a core skill in any domain, but it assumes particular importance for computer scientists, who need to communicate complex problems and concepts. Many different situations (thesis, job interview, fundraising, public presentation, scientific conference, technical pitch etc.) require the presenter to be able to convey effectively and efficiently the technical/scientific content, whatever the audience, the content and its complexity. The first part of the course is designed to familiarize students with academic research and writing academic texts. It explains the fundamental techniques of writing essays, posters, abstracts, journal articles, and theses. The second part offers guidelines for a large range of outreach communication from technical manual to social media."
