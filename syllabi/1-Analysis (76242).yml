  topics:
  - "Sequences and series"
  - "Univariate functions"
  - "Limits of functions and continuity"
  - "Derivatives, differentials and Taylor Theorem"
  - "Riemann integral"
  - "Logarithmic and exponential functions"
  teaching_format: The course includes frontal lectures and exercises.
  assessment: "The written exam will include verification questions, transfer-of-knowledge questions, and exercises. The purpose of the assessment is to evaluate the extent to which students have achieved the learning outcomes related to knowledge and understanding, the application of knowledge, and the ability to make informed judgments. These criteria apply equally to both attending and non-attending students."
  assessment_language: English
  evaluation_criteria: "The final written exam accounts for 100% of the final grade and covers the entire course program. Exam questions will be evaluated based on correctness, clarity, the quality of argumentation, and problem-solving ability."
